              <p>As you know, my name is Christina and I am a fur momma to a cute cat named Plato and a sweet dog named Birdie. I am currently a student at Lambda School working on a Web Development certificate. I was inspired to enter the tech industry by my love for technology and the lack of women in the industry.</p>

                <p>I'd like to thank my husband for the endless support he's given me as I dove into this new venture. He's truly been the best husband I could have ever asked for.</p>
